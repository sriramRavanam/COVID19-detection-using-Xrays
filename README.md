# Objective
Develop a model that can be embedded in an **Automatic Computer Aided Diagnosis** tool.
//NEED AN IMAGE HERE

# Description
Train a model to distinguish between covid19 infected and healthy _PA chest x-rays_ (Posterior-Anterior).
//NEED IMAGE HERE
Uses Transfer Learning to train a quick model to do task effectively.

# APIs used
1. Tensorflow
    1. Keras - build, train and test model.
2. SKLearn - split dataset and perform evaluation.
3. OpenCV - read and perform certain modifications to images.


# Results
We check results with different learning rates and batch sizes.

# Outcomes
* Learnt about the different ways to _pre-process_ the data.
* Understood concepts about _gradient descent_ and _back propagation_.
* Learnt how to _structure_ a deep learning project.
* Learnt the method to _train and evaluate_ a model.
